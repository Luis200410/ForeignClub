                            <p class="mb-4">Most language apps treat you like a solitary data point. They drill you on
                                vocabulary in isolation, leaving you frozen when it’s time to actually speak. We believe
                                fluency isn't about memorizing lists—it's about the messy, beautiful, high-stakes game
                                of connection.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">FOREIGN is a radical departure. We replace the lonely grind with a vibrant,
                                living community. You don't just "learn" English; you live it. You debate, you joke, you
                                negotiate, and you share your real life with people who are just as committed as you
                                are.</p>
                            <p>This is not a classroom. It's a global dinner table where the only rule is to keep the
                                conversation flowing. Welcome to the circle.</p>

                        <p class="text-ink-dim mb-4">Linguist Michael Long proposed that language acquisition happens
                            through "negotiation of meaning." When you struggle to make yourself understood in a real
                            conversation, your brain is forced to rewire itself. Passive listening isn't enough; you
                            need the friction of interaction.</p>
                        <p class="text-ink-dim">FOREIGN creates these moments of "productive friction" every single day.

                        <p class="text-ink-dim mb-4">Stephen Krashen identified that anxiety acts as a filter, blocking
                            language acquisition. If you're stressed, you can't learn. Traditional classrooms are
                            high-stress environments.</p>
                        <p class="text-ink-dim">We lower the stakes. By focusing on connection over correction, we lower
                            your "affective filter," allowing your brain to absorb the language naturally.</p>
